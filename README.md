This is a repository of all the projects I would like to showcase on my resume. I will also include a short desciption for each project here and each folder should have some sample files for a demo run :)

---DNA Matching Program---
Status: Complete

The DNA Matching program uses two files to function. The file containing the DNA strand itself and another file which contains the database of people and the DNA sequence we are matching for as well as how many matches each person has for each DNA sequence thats in the database file.

---Search Engine Program---
Status: Complete

The Search Engine program requires a single file which would contain a list of URLs along with body text or 'meta data' on the following line. The program uses maps for containers and has low time complexity.

---Animated Chart Program---
Status: Incomplete

The Animated Chart program would take a single file with data containing specific values. The program would read parts of the file and parse the data using classes and read each section of the input into into 'frames' with which the program would animate in the same style as stop motion animation.
